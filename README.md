### Predicting-Fluorescence-from-GFP-mutations

This is a project done for Generate Biomedicines 

The task is to build a model that predicts the fluorescence intensity of GFP molecules based on their amino acid sequence. The data are from Sarkisyan, K., Bolotin, D., Meer, M. et al. Local fitness landscape of the green fluorescent protein. Nature 533, 397â€“401 (2016). They consist of the sequences of 49,129 GFP molecules generated by random mutagenesis and measurements of their fluorescence intensities.

Included here is a single jupyter notebook that details my approach "GFP_modeling_DanCox.ipynb".
